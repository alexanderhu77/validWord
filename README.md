## A Simple Spell Checker

validWord is a shell script that reads text from standard input, extracts words using a reasonable definition (slightly broader than just [A-Za-z]), and outputs words not found in a predefined dictionary (sorted.words). If run with the dictionary file as input, it should produce no outputâ€”confirming all words in the dictionary are recognized as correctly spelled.
